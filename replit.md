# Overview

NexJob SEO Automation Plugin is a WordPress plugin designed to automate SEO optimization tasks for job-related content. The plugin has been successfully refactored from a monolithic 1289-line single file into a clean, modular architecture with separate components for settings management, post processing, logging, cron management, and admin interfaces. It provides automated SEO title and description generation, slug optimization, and comprehensive logging capabilities.

# System Architecture

## Plugin Architecture
The system follows a modular WordPress plugin architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Bootstrap Pattern**: Main plugin file (`nexjob-seo-automation.php`) serves as entry point with constants and initialization
- **Component-Based Design**: Core functionality split into specialized classes in the `includes/` directory
- **Orchestrator Pattern**: Central `NexJobSEOPlugin` class coordinates between components
- **WordPress Integration**: Leverages WordPress hooks, settings API, and cron system

## Core Components

### Settings Management
- Centralized configuration handling through WordPress Settings API
- Default value management system
- Separation of settings logic from business logic

### Post Processing Engine
- Dedicated component for SEO analysis and optimization
- Automated title and description generation
- URL slug optimization functionality

### Logging System
- Database-driven logging with custom table structure
- Log filtering and retrieval capabilities
- Statistics generation for monitoring

### Scheduled Processing
- WordPress cron integration for batch processing

### Admin Interface
- WordPress admin page integration

- Manual processing controls for immediate execution

### AJAX Handler System
- Dedicated endpoints for asynchronous operations
- Log management functionality
- Real-time interface updates

## Design Patterns
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class handles one specific concern
- **Dependency Injection**: Components receive dependencies rather than creating them
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses WordPress hooks for loose coupling
- **Factory Pattern**: Centralized component initialization
